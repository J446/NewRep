@article{Zerilli1987,
abstract = {An improved description of copper and ironcylinder impact (Taylor) test results has been obtained through the use of dislocationmechanicsbased constitutive relations in the Lagrangian material dynamics computer program EPIC2. The effects of strain hardening, strainrate hardening, and thermal softening based on thermal activation analysis have been incorporated into a reasonably accurate constitutive relation for copper. The relation has a relatively simple expression and should be applicable to a wide range of fcc materials. The effect of grain size is included. A relation for iron is also presented. It also has a simple expression and is applicable to other bcc materials but is presently incomplete, since the important effect of deformation twinning in bcc materials is not included. A possible method of acounting for twinning is discussed and will be reported on more fully in future work. A main point made here is that each material structure type (fcc, bcc, hcp) will have its own constitutive behavior, dependent on the dislocation characteristics for that particular structure.},

abstract = {6005A-T6 aluminum alloy is welded by stationary shoulder friction stir welding (SSFSW). At a constant rotational velocity of 2000. rpm, the effect of welding speed on mechanical properties of SSFSW joint are investigated in detail. Defect-free joint with gloss surface and small flash is attained and no cracks appear at the bending angle of 180°. Compared with traditional friction stir welding (FSW), width of rotational shoulder affected zone is relatively small because of the smaller diameter of rotational shoulder. Increasing welding speed is benefit for reducing the width of softening region and the softening degree. The fracture position of welding joint locates in thermo-mechanically affected zone and the fracture surface morphology presents the typical ductile fracture. The maximum tensile strength of joint at the welding speed of 400. mm/min reaches 82\% of base metal (BM). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The plastic anisotropy of cold-rolled high purity aluminum (99.996\%) and commercially pure aluminum (99.6\%) has been investigated. Sample parameters were the initial grain size and the degree of plastic strain (ϵ < 3.00). Flow stresses (0.2\% offset) were measured at room temperature by uniaxial tension as a function of the angle between the tensile axis and the rolling direction. Textures were determined by neutron diffraction, and Taylor M-factors were calculated. The microstructures were studied by TEM. It was found that the flow stress varies significantly with orientation both at low and high strains. It is shown that for most experimental conditions, texture effects alone cannot explain the observed anisotropy, and microstructural anisotropy effects have to be taken into account. In those cases, a correlation between the microstructural anisotropy and the development of microbands is discussed. On a \'{e}tudi\'{e} l'anisotropie plastique d'aluminiums lamin\'{e}s de haute puret\'{e} (99,996\%) et de puret\'{e} commerciale (99,6\%). Les param\`{e}tres de l'\'{e}chantillon sont la taille de grains initiale et le taux de d\'{e}formation plastique (ϵ < 3,00). Les contraintes d'\'{e}coulement (\`{a} 0,2\%) sont mesur\'{e}es \`{a} la temp\'{e}rature ambiante en tension uniaxiale, en fonction de l'angle entre l'axe de traction et la direction de laminage. Les textures ont \'{e}t\'{e} d\'{e}termin\'{e}es par diffraction neutronique et les facteurs M de Taylor ont \'{e}t\'{e} calcul\'{e}s. Les microstructures ont \'{e}t\'{e} \'{e}tudi\'{e}es par MET. La contrainte d'\'{e}coulement varie de fa\c{c}on significative avec l'orientation \`{a} la fois pour les faibles et pour les fortes d\'{e}formations. Pour la plupart des conditions exp\'{e}rimentales, les effets de texture seuls ne peuvent pas expliquer l'anisotropie que l'on observe, et l'on doit tenir compte des effets de l'anisotropie microstructurale. Dans ces cas l\`{a}, on discute une corr\'{e}lation entre l'anisotropie microstructurale et le d\'{e}veloppement de microbandes. Die plastische Anisotropie kaltgewalzten hochreinen (99,996\%) und kommerziell reinen (99,6\%) Aluminiums wurde untersucht. Als Probenparameter dienten die anf\"{a}ngliche Korngr\"{o}$\beta$e und der Grad der plastischen Dehnung (ϵ < 3,00). Die Flie$\beta$spannungen (bei 0,2\%) wurden bei Raumtemperatur unter einachsigem Zug in Abh\"{a}ngigkeit von dem Winkel zwischen der Zugachse und der Walzrichtung gemessen. Die Texturen wurden mittels Neutronenbeugung ermittelt; die Taylor-Faktoren wurden berechnet. Die Mikrostruktur wurde im Elektronenmikroskop untersucht. Die Flie$\beta$spannung \"{a}ndert sich mit der Orientierung sowohl bei niedrigen wie auch hohen Dehnungen betr\"{a}chtlich. Unter den meisten experimentellen Bedingungen k\"{o}nnen die Textureinfl\"{u}sse die beobachtete Anisotropie nicht erkl\"{a}ren, e m\"{u}ssen Effekte der Mikrostruktur ber\"{u}cksichtigt werden. F\"{u}r diese F\"{a}lle werden die Zusammenh\"{a}nge zwischen der Anisotropie der Mikrostruktur und der Entwicklung von Mikrob\"{a}ndern diskutiert.},

abstract = {This paper describes the application of the computational fluid dynamics (CID) code, FLUENT, to modelling the metal flow in friction stir welding (FSW). Building on a two-dimensional model, and preliminary trials with a novel 'Trivex' tool design, discussed in the companion paper immediately before this one, a full three-dimensional model was developed. The model predicted the temperature, and the traversing and down forces, which were compared against experiments. The model incorporated a novel 'slip' boundary condition, based on that developed in two dimensions. A conventional 'Triflute' tool was modelled and compared with the new 'Trivex' tool design. The model correctly predicted that the Trivex tool had lower traversing and down forces than its Triflute counterpart. To assist understanding of the material flow, streamlines around each of the tools were plotted. Ultimately the technique could be used to size the pin features reducing the need for costly experiments.},

The fundamental aspects of optical correlation are presented, with emphasis on the applicability of the technique to the analysis of micrographs obtained during in situ deformation studies. Without considering specific algorithms, this paper discusses important practical issues such as accuracy and spatial resolution and how these are affected by image quality and other experimental difficulties. The technique was used to analyse image sequences obtained during in situ deformation tensile tests on two very different materials: antler bone and ferritic steel. As the technique does not require patterns or coatings to be applied on the surface of interest, the strain maps obtained could be used to relate strain heterogeneity to the underlying microstructure.},

@book{Nunes1990,
abstract = {Welcome to the new edition of ASM Handbook, Volume 11, Failure Analysis and Prevention. Theme and Purpose of this Volume. The authors and editors assembled this Volume with several broad themes in mind. First, the most important goal of failure analysis is to decrease the occurrence of component failures through the understanding of the root cause for failure. Experienced failure analysts are often frustrated when, despite extensive engineering research, investigations, and failure analysis reports, the same types of failures occur again and again. When the root cause has been identified as defective global design rather than abuse or misuse, product quality and reliability is improved. The failure analyst should strive to uncover the underlying or root (technical) cause of the failure. The fact that a specific component appears to have failed in some way does not automatically mean that the component itself is defective. The problem may lie in the way the component was used, inspected, or maintained. If it is truly defective, then the analysis should determine whether the defect originates in design, manufacture (fabrication and assembly), material selection/processing, or unexpected service environment. This Volume provides a framework for investigating the above issues. In addition to sections devoted to design and manufacture, there are also sections on failures that occur through fracture, corrosion, and wear, as well as an article on failure through deformation. This Volume is also an attempt to address the principles, tools, techniques, and procedures necessary to plan, organize, and conduct a thorough investigation. Not every failure investigation is the same, and a failure root-cause analysis is more than a microstructural examination, a stress analysis, or a chemical corrosion analysis. All of these disciplines, as well as others, may be required to reach a root cause conclusion. No single volume, no matter how comprehensive, can present all the information that may potentially be needed. The emphasis of this Volume is on general principles with the widest applicability to situations that the reader is likely to encounter. References and sources of further information are provided throughout. While some common types of components or equipment may be included in some detail, not every type of machine can be treated. The reader is encouraged, and in fact urged, to pursue additional sources of information so as to understand the function and history of the component, machine, or system that is under investigation. Audience. One of the challenges in preparing a work of this type is the diversity of readership. Some readers are students and other novices who may be confronted with a failed part for the first time. They may be looking to the Handbook for guidance on where to start their analysis. Other readers are experienced practitioners, using the Handbook to verify or clarify a critical detail in their analysis. Thus, the contents of this Volume include the essential basics of failure analysis, as well as more advanced discussions from a research perspective. The discussions of fracture mechanisms are an example of this approach to Handbook organization. The articles Overload Failures and Fatigue Failures are good starting points for readers wishing to begin their study of fracture. Examination of the fracture surface (when failure did result in fracture) at both the macro and micro scale provides considerable information pertinent to a failure investigation. This subject is introduced in the article Overload Failures with some discussion of the mechanisms that may be involved. For some readers, these may be sufficient, if all they need is to identify the basic fracture mechanism. However, further study can sometimes allow the analyst to learn more about the circumstances of a fracture. Unfortunately, there are few instances in which a single fractographic feature is definitive in identifying a root cause (and to distinguish between abuse and defective design). Casual examination may not distinguish between fine details caused by different fracture processes. Consequently, a detailed study of the fracture surface at both the macroscale and microscale is helpful and may be critical in obtaining a root cause conclusion. The reader who desires a more detailed appreciation and thorough understanding should continue with the article Fracture Appearance and Mechanisms of Deformation and Fracture and the article Stress Analysis and Fracture Mechanics. These articles introduce quantitative means to relate the fracture process to material properties and, therefore, are critical to distinguishing between abuse or misuse and inadequate quality. Finally, the article Mechanisms and Appearances of Ductile and Brittle Fracture in Metals provides a still more in-depth treatment on the detailed appearances at both the macroscale and microscale, with the intent of extracting the maximum possible information for root-cause failure analysis. Differences of Opinion. Controversy is, perhaps, inherent in the very nature of failure analysis. If anything, that is even truer today when real or perceived failures are the subject of litigation. The authors have integrated thoughts on legal considerations into many of the articles. However, nothing here should be taken as legal advice. Those who are concerned regarding legal implications should consult competent counsel. Furthermore, as every circumstance is somewhat unique, the Handbook should be used with care and should not be the sole source of information when critical decisions are to be made. Most articles include extensive references, which should be reviewed if further information is required. The authors present analyses and interpretations based on scientific principles and experience. All of the articles have been reviewed and edited. However, there can be and still are differences of opinion among failure analysts regarding some issues. It is up to the reader to determine whether the information presented is applicable and helpful in a particular situation. Experienced analysts should be consulted if there is any doubt. Despite the best efforts of the authors, reviewers, and editors, the reader might find an area that could be improved. If so, please bring this to the attention of the ASM Editors so that your concern can be reviewed and, depending on the consensus of opinion, can be addressed in subsequent printings. Collaborative Effort. This Volume reflects the efforts of many people. Except for ASM staff, all are volunteers. Many of the volunteers are fully employed and contributed their personal time to the project. Neither they nor their employers receive any compensation for their efforts, except for the satisfaction that accrues from being able to share what they have learned, prevent failures, and contribute to safer, more reliable products. The names of the authors, editors, reviewers, and ASM staff are acknowledged individually elsewhere in this Volume and are too numerous to list here. However, ASM Editor Steven Lampman does deserve special mention for his commitment, dedication, and patience, without which this Volume would not have become a reality. It has been most enjoyable and professionally rewarding to work with all who were involved in this effort. On behalf of ASM and the readers of this Handbook, we express our appreciation to all for the time and effort expended and for their willingness to share their knowledge and lessons derived from experience. Many of the contributors have established national and international reputations in their respective fields. More than any words of appreciation in a Preface such as this, however, it is our hope that the Handbook itself will be a most fitting tribute to all participants, both now and into the future.},

abstract = {Prediction of shear band formation and other strain localization processes presents many computational challenges that must be overcome to enable dynamic failure prediction and material design of ductile material systems. The current work presents a finite element based computational framework accounting for this critical deformation process, as applied to a detailed investigation of friction stir welded (FSW) aluminum joints. A stir welded joint has several zones, each with distinct microstructural characteristics and material properties. For applications in Army land vehicles, which may be subject to under-body blast, an understanding of the energy absorption capability of these joints is needed. Thus material inhomogeneity, dynamic loading, and detailed understanding of small scale failure processes must all be accounted for to accurately model FSW material behavior. In this study, an implicit nonlinear consistent (INC) or monolithic solution technique is used to predict shear band formation and estimate the energy absorption and failure strain of a stir welded aluminum joint. It has been shown that failure initiating at material interface regions can be predicted, and furthermore that abrupt material property gradients predominantly contribute to FSW joint failure. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Evolution of plate-like precipitates of the $\Omega$ phase in an Al–1.9Cu–0.3Mg–0.2Ag (at.\%) alloy has been investigated by three-dimensional atom probe (3DAP) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) techniques. In an as-quenched alloy, all solute atoms are uniformly dissolved. After 5s aging at 180°C, co-clusters of Ag and Mg atoms are present. Initially, these co-clusters do not have well-defined shape, but after aging for 120s, they are aligned on the \{111\} planes incorporating Cu atoms. Initially, they do not have the distinct structure consistent with the $\Omega$ phase, thus these are designated as \{111\}GP zones. The $\Omega$ platelet which appears after the \{111\}GP zones contain all solute elements within the precipitate having a composition of approximately 25at.\% Cu, 20at.\% Mg and 10at.\% Ag. In the well-defined $\Omega$ phase which appears after 2 and 10h aging at 180°C, Ag and Mg atoms are strongly segregated to the broad face monolayer interfaces of $\alpha$/$\Omega$. No Mg and Ag are incorporated within the platelet, and its chemical composition is Al–33at.\% Cu. Based on these observations, it is concluded that the $\Omega$ phase evolves from co-clusters to plate-like precipitates continuously, rather than precipitating discretely by heterogeneous nucleation to their precursors. In a well-grown $\Omega$ plate, elemental mapping near a ledge was observed by 3DAP for the first time.},

abstract = {Industrially produced continuous cast (CC) aluminum alloys AA5182 and AA5052 were heat-treated at a low temperature of 182°C for different times (30 and 100h). Samples from the hot band (hot band in continuous cast process is produced through hot rolling of the materials at relatively high temperatures, usually from 490 to 310°C) and the heat-treated materials were prepared for microstructure examination, chemical composition analysis, electrical resistivity testing and tensile testing. Particle structures of CC5182 alloy show precipitation along the grain boundaries after this low temperature heat-treatment. The particles were identified by SEM analysis to be Mg precipitates (Mg2Al3). Due to the Mg precipitation, electrical resistivity, elongation and ultimate tensile strength decreased. As the interaction between Mg solute atoms in solid solution and mobile dislocations decreases due to precipitation, the magnitude of the stress drop in the serrations decreases and the critical strain for the onset of serrated yielding increases in CC5182 alloy. These phenomena do not occur in CC5052 alloy since precipitation either does not occur or is much weaker in this alloy. An inverse serrated yielding behavior, which is characterized by an increase in the critical strain for the onset of serrated yielding with a decrease in strain rate, occurs in CC5182 alloy but not in CC5052 alloy. This inverse behavior is believed to be related to precipitation during tensile deformation in CC5182 alloy.},

@article{Ngo2007,
abstract = {The use of vehicle bombs to attack city centers has been a feature of campaigns by terrorist organizations around the world. A bomb explosion within or immediately nearby a building can cause catastrophic damage on the building's external and internal structural frames, collapsing of walls, blowing out of large expanses of windows, and shutting down of critical life-safety systems. Loss of life and injuries to occupants can result from many causes, including direct blast-effects, structural collapse, debris impact, fire, and smoke. The indirect effects can combine to inhibit or prevent timely evacuation, thereby contributing to additional casualties. In addition, major catastrophes resulting from gas-chemical explosions result in large dynamic loads, greater than the original design loads, of many structures. Due to the threat from such extreme loading conditions, efforts have been made during the past three decades to develop methods of structural analysis and design to resist blast loads. The analysis and design of structures subjected to blast loads require a detailed understanding of blast phenomena and the dynamic response of various structural elements. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the effects of explosion on structures. An explanation of the nature of explosions and the mechanism of blast waves in free air is given. This paper also introduces different methods to estimate blast loads and structural response.},

abstract = {A dislocation mechanics based constitutive equation explanation is given for the observation that face-centered-cubic (fcc) metals are less shear band prone than body-centered-cubic (bee) ones. Factors relating to plastic flow mechanisms within the polycrystal grains of a material as well as at the boundaries between the grains are important: 1. (1) In the fcc case, dislocation “forest” intersections that accumulate with increased straining produce a thermally-activated component of the polycrystal flow stress. As a consequence, the dislocation forest build-up gives a positive strain rate dependence of strain hardening that leads to more stable plastic flow.2. (2) In bcc metals and alloys, more so than fcc ones, dislocation pile-up stress concentrations occur at the polycrystal grain boundaries to produce a strong (Hall-Petch) grain size dependence of the plastic flow stress. The localized heating at such pile-up breakthroughs provides a fundamental mechanism for the promotion of shear banding.},

abstract = {An application of the split Hopkinson pressure bar to the dynamic testing of materials is given whereby continuous records of the strain vs. time, strain rate vs. time, stress vs. time, and stress vs. strain may be simultaneously recorded. For many materials a nearly constant true plastic strain rate can be maintained for loading durations on the order of 100 $\mu$sec. The assumptions made in applying the method are checked experimentally. Three annealed face centred cubic metals—lead, aluminium, and copper, are tested both dynamically and at lower strain rates to determine their rate sensitivity. The results indicate that a single thermally activated mechanism is predominant. A possible mechanism of this type is the intersection of glide and forest dislocations. In aluminium, the previous strain rate history of loading is shown to affect the material's dynamic response only. A rapid annealing effect is also evidenced. Finally, the method is shown to be applicable to some non-metallic materials.},

abstract = {The solute clusters and the metastable precipitates in aged Al-Mg-Si alloys have been characterized by a three-dimensional atom probe (3DAP) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). After long-term natural aging, Mg-Si co-clusters have been detected in addition to separate Si and Mg atom clusters. The particle density of ????? after 10 h artificial aging at 175 ??C varies depending on pre-aging conditions, i.e. pre-aging at 70 ??C increases the number density of the ????? precipitates, whereas natural aging reduces it. This suggests that the spherical GP zones formed at 70 ??C serve as nucleation sites for the ????? in the subsequent artificial aging, whereas co-clusters formed at room temperature do not. Atom probe analysis results have revealed that the Mg:Si ratios of the GP zones and the ????? precipitates in the alloy with excess amount of Si are 1:1, whereas those in the Al-Mg2Si quasi-binary alloy are 2:1. Based on these results, the characteristic two-step age-hardening behavior in Al-Mg-Si alloys is discussed.},

abstract = {In the present investigation, a numerical three-dimensional (3-D) heat flow model for friction stir welding (FSW) has been developed, based on the method of finite differences. The algorithm, which is implemented in MATLAB 5.2, is provided with a separate module for calculation of the microstructure evolution and the resulting hardness distribution. The process model is validated by comparison with in-situ thermocouple measurements and experimental hardness profiles measured at specific time intervals after welding to unravel the strength recovery during natural aging. Furthermore, the grain structure within the plastically deformed region of the as-welded materials has been characterized by means of the electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) technique in the scanning electron microscope (SEM), Some practical applications of the process model are described toward the end of the article.},

abstract = {The finite element method (FEM) can be successfully applied to various field problems in solid mechanics, fluid mechanics and electrical engineering. FEM is a numerical method widely used in computer aided engineering, which allows for modelling and analysis of engineering and mathematical problems, e.g. safety testing. This reference text is the first to discuss finite element methods for structures with large stochastic variations. Stochastic variations are those that follow a random probability distribution or pattern and whose behavior may be analyzed statistically but not predicted precisely. Graduate students, lecturers and researchers in mathematics, engineering and scientific computation will find this a very useful reference. This book is the latest in the Oxford Texts in Applied and Engineering Mathematics Series, which includes textx based on taught courses that explain the mathematical or computational techniques required for the resolution of fundamental applied problems, from the undergraduate through to the graduate level.},

@article{Genevois2005,
abstract = {During friction stir welding, the temperature history and the deformation rate introduced through the joint vary. For precipitation hardening aluminium alloys, these parameters strongly influence the precipitation distribution, which controls the weld properties. This paper presents a quantitative investigation of the effect of welding on precipitation in the 2024 alloy in the T351 and the T6 states, using small angle X-ray scattering, transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and hardness measurements. Depending on the peak temperature, the main precipitation phenomena are Guinier Preston Bagaryatskii zone dissolution, precipitation of S???(S), which can be either a hardening agent at small sizes or detrimental to the mechanical properties at large sizes. The quantification of the microstructure has allowed modelling of the yield stress evolution through the weld according to an appropriate mixing law for the contributions of the different obstacles. The effect of a T6 post-welding heat treatment has also been studied on a T351 weld. This treatment actually results in a further softening of the thermo-mechanically affected zone. In parallel, the susceptibility to strain localisation during tensile testing of the weld has been evaluated by the digital image correlation technique. ?? 2005 Acta Materialia Inc.
